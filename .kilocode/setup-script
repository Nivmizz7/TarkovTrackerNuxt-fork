# Kilo Code Worktree Setup Script
# This script runs before the agent starts in a worktree (new sessions only).
#
# Available environment variables:
#   WORKTREE_PATH  - Absolute path to the worktree directory
#   REPO_PATH      - Absolute path to the main repository
#
# Example tasks:
#   - Copy .env files from main repo
#   - Install dependencies
#   - Run database migrations
#   - Set up local configuration

set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, unset vars, or pipeline failures

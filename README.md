## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
# Required for login/sync features
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anonymous_key

# Optional: API gateway URLs (for team features)
# NUXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_GATEWAY_URL=

## Cloudflare Workers

The project uses two Cloudflare Workers, each with a Durable Object binding for rate limiting:

- `workers/api-gateway` — API request gateway
  - `API_GATEWAY_LIMITER` (Durable Object)
- `workers/team-gateway` — Team feature gateway
  - `TEAM_GATEWAY_LIMITER` (Durable Object)

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
